*Warning*: Repository is work in progress! 

This repository deals with the generation of a simulation environment for room impulse response measurements. 
It contains a measuring chain which simulates parameters occuring in reality (microphone, preamp, DAC, ...).
It will be considered only linear time-invariant systems. The user can choose between different parameters (type
of exication signals, length of signal, type of windowing, intensity and type of noise, sampling frequency, ...) , which exicate the "Device Under Test" (DUT).
